# Games or Growth: Public Investment Tradeoffs in Alberta’s Sport Tourism Economy


# Decision Maker: 
Alberta Minister of Tourism and Sport


# Decision: 
Should the Government of Alberta prioritize public investment in major sport tourism events and facilities, or direct those funds toward supporting local small business development in the hospitality sector?


# Executive Summary
Sport tourism has become an increasingly prominent component of Alberta’s economic development strategy, with major sporting events, competitions, and sport infrastructure investments positioned as tools for attracting visitors, stimulating local spending, and supporting employment in the hospitality and tourism sectors. High-profile events such as national championships and international tournaments generate short-term economic activity through increased hotel occupancy, restaurant revenue, transportation demand, and retail spending. At the same time, Alberta’s local hospitality and tourism businesses continue to face structural challenges related to seasonality, workforce shortages, and uneven recovery across regions and communities. This creates a critical policy question regarding how limited public funds should be allocated to maximize long-term economic value.

The central decision facing Alberta’s economic and tourism policymakers is whether to prioritize public investment in attracting and hosting major sport tourism events and facilities, or to direct those resources toward sustained support for locally owned hospitality and tourism businesses. While sport tourism can produce concentrated economic boosts and international visibility, its benefits may be unevenly distributed and time-limited. In contrast, direct local business investment may strengthen long-term economic resilience but lack the visibility and immediate impact associated with large-scale events. This decision matters because it shapes employment patterns, business sustainability, community development, and the overall structure of Alberta’s tourism economy, influencing whether growth is driven by episodic event-based surges or by stable, locally anchored enterprise development.
