# Full Background of the Project

Sport tourism has become a growing economic force in Alberta, prompting policymakers to consider how best to allocate limited public funds to maximize economic and community benefits. Sport tourism refers to travel that involves either participating in or attending sporting events, which generates spending on accommodations, food and beverage, retail, and local services. In Alberta, data from multiple municipalities shows that hosting sport events contributes millions of dollars to regional and provincial economies. For example, in 2024 over 214 sport events in Lethbridge generated more than $21.5 million in economic impact for the province, including $18 million for the city itself, through spending by out-of-town participants, staff, and spectators on lodging, dining, and other local services (Lethbridge Sport Council, 2025/2026).


The stakes of the decision to prioritize sport tourism events versus direct investment in local hospitality and small business development are both economic and social. On one hand, sport tourism can lead to sizeable short-term boosts in local spending and employment. Beyond Lethbridge, elite sport events such as the FIS Snowboard World Cups and Nordiq Ski Nationals are anticipated to contribute economic activity worth millions to host cities such as Calgary and Canmore, supported by provincial grant funding (Alberta sport event reports, 2025). Further highlighting the potential for large impacts, the announcement that Edmonton and Red Deer will co-host the 2027 IIHF World Junior Championship underscores the province’s ability to attract major international events with projected economic impacts exceeding $90 million, offering opportunities for hospitality sectors across two metropolitan regions (International Ice Hockey Federation, 2025).


However, this decision is not straightforward. First, not all communities experience the same level of economic benefit. Smaller or recurring regional events may bring modest impact compared to internationally broadcast tournaments, and impacts can vary across sectors and demographic groups. Local businesses that do not directly benefit from sports tourism, such as those outside downtown hotel and restaurant corridors, might receive little economic spillover. In addition, investments to secure and stage large sport events often require public funding that could otherwise be directed toward small business grants, workforce development, or infrastructure improvements that benefit local entrepreneurs year-round.


The decision also involves tension between long-term economic strategies and short-term returns. While sport tourism may produce spikes in revenue during events, its effects after the events conclude can be limited if communities lack ongoing tourism streams. Conversely, targeted support for local hospitality and small businesses, for example through marketing assistance, business training, or property tax relief can strengthen economic resilience over longer horizons.


Key stakeholders affected by this decision include municipal and provincial governments who allocate funding and manage tourism strategy, local business owners in hospitality, retail, and services who may gain from increased visitor traffic; residents concerned about tax use and potential disruptions from large events; and sport organizations that depend on visible platforms and hosting opportunities. Sport tourism advocates emphasize showcased city branding and employment opportunities, whereas local business groups may seek predictable, sustained economic growth rather than the boom-and-bust cycles associated with events.


Currently, Alberta’s approach blends elements of both strategies. Provincial grant programs support hosting sport competitions, while hotel associations and tourism bodies work to expand broader visitor economies through conventions and other events (Calgary Hotel Association, 2025). This dual approach reflects an ongoing policy debate about the best use of economic development funds in a competitive tourism landscape.
